# Hello, I'm Dimitar Nikolov

Web development is my passion, and I've dedicated myself to mastering it.

I've always been a natural problem solver, curious about the inner workings of websites and applications
I've completed several projects that showcase my abilities, and I invite you to explore them at my GitHub account to see firsthand what I can bring to your projects.

I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET, Bootstrap, Angular, Typescript and SQL. However, I am always eager to learn and add new skills to my repertoire to stay competitive in the ever-changing job market.

I am enthusiastic about connecting with fellow software engineers and industry professionals. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always open to networking and collaborating on exciting projects.
